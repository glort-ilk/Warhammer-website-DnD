    <p>Victory: The beacon is destroyed, weakening the enemy forces.</p>
    <p>Failure: The Warp rift grows larger, summoning a greater daemon.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Massive battle sequence: Thousands of troops clash, titans duel in the distance, and the players must fight to survive.</li>

    <li>The players have a choice:</li> 
    
    <ol>
      <li> Hold the last line at the fortress gates.</li> 
      <li> Assassinate the enemy warlord leading the Chaos forces.</li>
      <li> Activate the fortress self-destruct and escape before the enemy captures the planet.</li>
    </ol>
